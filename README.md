Notes for Compiling on Windows
---------
Note: This is a very basic explanation. I am working on a more detailed explanation, but don't have the time right now.

This project uses elements from C++11, like initialization lists. Visual Studio does not support initialization lists in the 2010 or 2012 versions. Therefore, I recommend installing/using CMake and MinGW's g++ compiler.
